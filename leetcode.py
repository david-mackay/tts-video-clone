## Issues
Please open issues under: https://github.com/flathub/com.vscodium.codium/issues

## FAQ

This version is running inside a _container_ and is therefore __not able__
to access SDKs on your host system!

### To execute commands on the host system, run inside the sandbox:

```bash
  $ flatpak-spawn --host <COMMAND>
```

### Host Shell

To make the Integrated Terminal automatically use the host system's shell,
you can add this to the settings of vscodium:

```json
  {
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "bash",
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
        "bash": {
          "path": "/usr/bin/flatpak-spawn",
          "args": ["--host", "--env=TERM=xterm-256color", "bash"]
        }
    },
  }
```

### SDKs

This flatpak provides a standard development environment (gcc, python, etc).
To see what's available:

```bash
  $ flatpak run --command=sh com.vscodium.codium
  $ ls /usr/bin (shared runtime)
  $ ls /app/bin (bundled with this flatpak)
```
To get support for additional languages, you have to install SDK extensions, e.g.

```bash
  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.dotnet
  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.golang
  $ FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT=dotnet,golang flatpak run com.vscodium.codium
```
You can use

```bash
  $ flatpak search <TEXT>
```
to find others.

### Run flatpak codium from host terminal

If you want to run `codium /path/to/file` from the host terminal just add this
to your shell's rc file

```bash
alias codium="flatpak run com.vscodium.codium --no-sandbox "
```

then reload sources, now you could try:

```bash 
$ codium /path/to/
# or
$ FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT=dotnet,golang codium /path/to/
```

### Enable experimental native Wayland mode
You can temporarily run VSCodium in experimental native Wayland mode with:  

```
flatpak run com.vscodium.codium --no-sandbox --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
```  

Native Wayland can improve: HiDPI support, rendering performance, kinetic scrolling, touch support and also avoids needing xwayland. [See VSCode issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/109176). These flags are from Chromium and Electron, which currently consider native Wayland support experimental and opt-in. [See Electron issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10915).

Note window decorations will currently be missing on GNOME/Mutter. [See this potential fix](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/29618).

## Deprecation of arm(32bits) builds

> - `armhf/armv7` builds have their particular branch named __armv7__ and will
be deprecated on 2021 due to the `org.freedesktop.Sdk` versions >=
[20.08](https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/-/tags/freedesktop-sdk-20.08.0)
disable armv7 builds. You can follow the discusion 
[here](https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/-/issues/1105).
> - This particular branch is based on `org.freedesktop.Sdk` == 19.08 that be
supported until 2021, you can read more about it
[here](https://wiki.gnome.org/GUADEC/2019/Hackingdays/FreedesktopSdk/Notes).
